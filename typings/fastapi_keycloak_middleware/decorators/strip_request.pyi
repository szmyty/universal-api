"""
Convenience wrapper that handles removing the request argument from the function
arguments if needed. As the actual function does not include the argument, it
would lead to a Python exception if the argument is not removed.

This wrapper will check if the function contains the request argument and if
not, will remove it from kwargs before calling the function.
